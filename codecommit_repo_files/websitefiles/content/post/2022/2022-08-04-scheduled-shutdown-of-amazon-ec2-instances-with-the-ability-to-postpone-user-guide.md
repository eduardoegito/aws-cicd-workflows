# Introduction
In my previous blog, I outlined the steps for deploying a solution that I had created, to shut down Amazon EC2 instances on a schedule.

The ability to easily postpone scheduled shutdowns temporarily has been extremely helpful to me, in situations where on those “once in a blue moon” nights, I found myself working through the night and didn’t want the server to suddenly be shut down due to a schedule.
